# Estimate for Mike

Power BI theme estimate.

Brief: Develop a complete set of data visualisations in line with the new WTW 2022 branding.

Default templates are in this repository: https://github.com/MattRudy/PowerBI-ThemeTemplates

All visuals for Power BI that will require rebranding:

Area Chart
Azure Map
Button
Card
Clustered Bar Chart
Clustered Column Chart
Decomposition Tree
Donut Chart
Esri ArcGIS Map
Filled Map
Funnel Chart
Gauge
Hundred Percent Stacked Bar Chart
Hundred Percent Stacked Column Chart
Image
Key Influencers
KPI
Line Chart
Line and Clustered Column Chart
Line and Stacked Column Chart
Map
Matrix
Multi-row Card
Pie Chart
Q&A
Ribbon Chart
Scatter Chart
Shape
Shape Map
Slicer
Stacked Area Chart
Stacked Bar Chart
Stacked Column Chart
Table
Textbox
Treemap
Waterfall


Steps:

Day 1 (1 day)
Set up a new public repo
Advanced research and potentially post to the Power BI forum for expert free help

Day 2 (2 days)
Create some automation strategies based on the research such as global search and replace in all json files to speed up the development process

Day 4 (1 day)
Prepare 4 graphs with new branding and send for review

Day 5 (1 day)
Implement initial feedback

Day 6 (4 days)
Replicate branding in code across all graphs in all theme json files

Day 10 (2 days)
Send all Power BI templates for review, write documentation, clean up

Day 12 (1 day)
Implement all feedback 

Day 13 (1 day)
Implement feedback round 2

Adding 25% more time only to the estimate for blockers as this is quite a straight forward project. 

Initial development estimate:

14 to 18 working days for full project completion.

# Power BI Theme Templates
[![Validate JSONs](https://github.com/MattRudy/PowerBI-ThemeTemplates/actions/workflows/tests-validate-json.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/MattRudy/PowerBI-ThemeTemplates/actions/workflows/tests-validate-json.yml)

### Snippets for assembling Power BI Themes

#### [Get them here](https://github.com/mattrudy/PowerBI-ThemeTemplates) or view the visual list below

- Are you working with Themes in Power BI but confused about the visual formatting options (visualStyles)?  
- Have you struggled while trying to make sense of the [Power BI report themes documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-report-themes)?  
- Do you like JSON?  
- Do you like sample code?
- Do you like *other people* doing most of the labor for you?

If you answered "Yes" to any of the questions above, this repo is for *YOU*!

![Sample Power BI Shape Template](https://github.com/MattRudy/PowerBI-ThemeTemplates/blob/6f22b34e1fb13f5c9f7a49d5017bd6397268b0e4/ShapeTemplate.PNG "Sample Shape Template")

Changing colors in Power BI themes is fairly straightforward. For formatting, the wildcard(*) to make universal changes is convenient. If you want to go deeper into individual visual properties, however, it can quickly get confusing. With these sample templates, explore the individual properties available to *each* visual (as well as shapes and images). Combine the per-visual templates as needed, alter the values to correspond to your own needs, and build your own Power BI theme.

The purpose of this repository is to provide detail-level reference for each native visual in its own separate file. Look at the format options for a visual in Power BI Desktop and compare to the JSON options side by side. Copy and paste what you need from each visual's JSON to assemble a master Theme file.

Please note that the values in these sample files will appear *ugly*. Many values are not Power BI's defaults. As soon as something worked, I moved on to the next property. Please modify or remove properties in your own theme file to be what you desire.

## How do you find theme properties? üîç
It's possible to explore a Power BI Desktop file on your local computer to see the properties that are set, even if they aren't documented by Microsoft yet.
Check out [this great article](https://nolock.medium.com/how-to-discover-undocumented-theme-settings-in-power-bi-desktop-dcbe264351c8) for a guide on how to extract these properties.

### Areas considered "In-Scope" for this repository: ‚úÖ
1. one global-level theme template to help understand global-level settings.
1. one template per available visual, covering all default Power BI visuals as well as many custom visuals, to help understand visual-level settings.

### Areas considered "Out-of-Scope" for this repository: üö´
1. pre-built color themes (You can find these in [Microsoft's official themes gallery])
1. Theme samples to solve specific problems such as adding outlines or hiding visual headers on every visual (You can find these samples in [mattrudy/PowerBIThemeSolutions])
1. JSON file generator for anyone who doesn't want to write their own JSON file (You can use the [JSON Generator from PowerBI.Tips])
